# Optimizing-OD-Models---HPC

The goal of this project is to analyze the performance of object detection models on various hardware accelerators using profiling tools and optimization techniques. 
Our objective is to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the performance of these models for faster training and inference.
We aim to achieve this objective by exploring different approaches and techniques, such as quantization, pruning, and model compression, and evaluating their impact on the accuracy and performance of the models. 
The ultimate goal is to develop a systematic performance analysis study that can guide the selection and optimization of object detection models for different hardware accelerators
